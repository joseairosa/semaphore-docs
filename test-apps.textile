abstract: Applications for testing Semaphore

To make sure that Semaphore works with various database drivers, test frameworks etc, we've created a number of simple open source test apps. We then build these apps on Semaphore to verify that it works.

h2. Contributing

While we do our best to solve any problem our users have on our own, we also welcome being told what's inside your app that we do not support, so that we can get to it faster. We'd also be delighted to see our users make their testapp flavors. Either way, shoot us an email at "semaphore@renderedtext.com":mailto:semaphore@renderedtext.com.
