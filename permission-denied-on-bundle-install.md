Make sure that your Gemfile is referencing a repository with a public, read-only URL and not with a private SSH URL which requires presence of your personal SSH key.

This is good:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "rails-settings", :git => "https://github.com/renderedtext/rails-settings.git"
{% endhighlight %}

This won't work (unless you insert a working SSH key into the build environment, which is not necessary unless it's a [private repository](/how-to-build-project-with-private-gems)):

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "rails-settings", :git => "git@github.com:renderedtext/rails-settings.git"
{% endhighlight %}
