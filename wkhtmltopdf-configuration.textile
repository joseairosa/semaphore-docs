title: Wkhtmltopdf Configuration
---

To build an application that is using wkhtmltopdf for generating PDF files, you need to remove wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltopdf-binary gems from your Gemfile. wkhtmltopdf is preinstalled on Semaphore build servers.

To use wkhtmltopdf on your local development machine after removing wkhtmltopdf gem, you need to do following:

* remove executable wkhtmltopdf file that was installed with the gem (eg. your_project_path/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.2/bin/wkhtmltopdf)
* install binary version of wkhtmltopdf from the official site:

bc. wget http://wkhtmltopdf.googlecode.com/files/wkhtmltopdf-0.9.9-static-amd64.tar.bz2
tar xvjf wkhtmltopdf-0.9.9-static-amd64.tar.bz2 
sudo chown root:root wkhtmltopdf-amd64 
sudo mv wkhtmltopdf-amd64 /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf

* or use wkhtmltopdf package provided by your OS distribution
