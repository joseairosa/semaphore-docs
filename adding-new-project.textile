abstract: How your authorization of Semaphore and repository permissions on GitHub affect the process
---

If you've authorized Semaphore to build from public GitHub repositories, you will be able to build only public (open source) projects that you have created or been added to.

If you've authorized Semaphore to build from private GitHub repositories, you will be able to build both private and public projects that you participate in via your account or any organization you belong to.

In both cases, you need to have admin permissions on the repository. This is because with your authorized credentials, Semaphore needs to automatically set up post-commit hooks and SSH deploy keys.
