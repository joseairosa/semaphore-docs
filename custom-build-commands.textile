You can easily customize commands that Semaphore executes in order to build your project.

Typical use cases for custom build commands that we have seen so far are:

 * setting up custom database configuration files
 * calling a custom rake task for setting up seed db data
 * passing special flags to default rake tasks
 * exporting environment variables that contain sensitive information which you donâ€™t want to keep in your repository

Each build or deploy command is executed as a Linux shell command.

To change commands follow the simple steps bellow.

h2. 1. Click on "settings" next to your project on the dashboard.

h3. 2. Review your commands

If your plan allows, you can schedule your commands to run in multiple threads. Click "Change build commands" to edit them.

Note that Semaphore exports some "environment variables":/available-environment-variables which might be useful to you. You can also install additional packages with commands like @sudo apt-get install -y something@.
