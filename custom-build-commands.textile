title: Custom build commands

You can easily customize commands that Semaphore executes in order to build your project.

Typical use cases for custom build commands that we have seen so far are:

 * setting up custom database configuration files
 * calling a custom rake task for setting up seed db data
 * passing special flags to default rake tasks
 * exporting environment variables that contain sensitive information which you donâ€™t want to keep in your repository


To change commands follow the simple steps bellow.

h2. 1. Click on "settings" next to your project on the dashboard.

Note that Semaphore exports some "environment variables":/available-environment-variables which might be useful to you.
