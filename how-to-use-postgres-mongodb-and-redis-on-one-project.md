title: Can I use Postgres, MongoDB and Redis on one project?
---

Yes. Select Postgres as your database in project settings; that will make sure that Semaphore injects a working `database.yml` file.

For Mongo, youâ€™ll need to add build command such as:

{% highlight bash %}
cp config/mongoid.yml.example config/mongoid.yml
{% endhighlight %}

Default MongoDB configuration file that you use in development will work, no credentials are required.

Redis is running on default port and by default works without any configuration.
