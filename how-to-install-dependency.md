Important packages that are available in the platform are listed in the [Version Information](/version-information) article.

Additional dependencies can be added by simply adding an installation command to your build settings:

{% highlight javascript %}
sudo apt-get install -y libawesome-dev
{% endhighlight %}

If you need help, just [email us](mailto:semaphore@renderedtext.com) with your needs. If not, we’d still love to hear from you – knowing that many people are using a particular dependency generally encourages us to add it to platform.
