title: How can I add or remove a collaborator from my project?
---

If someone has joined or left the project on GitHub after you've added it to Semaphore, you need to tell Semaphore to update its list of collaborators.

To do that, the project owner (on Semaphore) should go to project settings > “Collaborators” and then click on “Sync collaborators from GitHub”.

If you need to provide repository owners (on Github) access to Semaphore project
you have to add owner to a same team where developer, who adds repository to Semaphore, is.
