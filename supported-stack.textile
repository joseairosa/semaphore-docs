Semaphore can build Rails 3 applications based on Ruby 1.9 and Bundler. It supports the following:

h3. Database engines

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* SQLite
* Redis

h3. Test frameworks

* RSpec
* Cucumber with Capybara and Selenium
* test/unit

We have a number of open source "test apps":/test-apps in various flavors that we use for verification. If your setup is different, we encourage you to read that page and <a href="mailto:semaphore@renderedtext.com">contact us</a> - we'd be happy to get your app building on Semaphore as quickly as possible.
