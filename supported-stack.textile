Semaphore can build programs based on Ruby and Bundler. At the moment it fully supports the following:

h3. Database engines

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* SQLite
* Redis
* MongoDB

h3. Test frameworks and backends

* test/unit
* RSpec
* Cucumber
* Steak
* Capybara with Selenium
* Capybara Webkit
* Poltergeist and PhantomJS

You can also use any other, provided it's configured in your bundle and you add a "custom build command":/custom-build-commands, including:

* Jasmine
* Minitest

For a more detailed list of prepared dependencies, please see the "Version Information":/version-information page.

We have a number of open source "test apps":/test-apps in various flavors that we use for verification. If your setup is different or you're having problems making your build pass, we encourage you to <a href="mailto:semaphore@renderedtext.com">contact us</a> - we'd be happy to get your app building on Semaphore as quickly as possible.
