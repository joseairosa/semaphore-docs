title: Supported application stack - Semaphore Documentation
---

Semaphore can build programs based on Ruby 1.9 and Bundler. At the moment it fully supports the following:

h3. Database engines

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* SQLite
* Redis
* MongoDB

These are used typically with Rails 3.

h3. Test frameworks

* RSpec
* Cucumber with Capybara and Selenium
* Capybara Webkit
* test/unit

You can also use any other, provided it's configured in your bundle and you add a "custom build command":/custom-build-commands if necessary, including:

* Jasmine
* Minitest

Other tools available on request:

* Poltergeist and PhantomJS
* Sphinx
* CouchDB

We have a number of open source "test apps":/test-apps in various flavors that we use for verification. If your setup is different, we encourage you to read that page and <a href="mailto:semaphore@renderedtext.com">contact us</a> - we'd be happy to get your app building on Semaphore as quickly as possible.
